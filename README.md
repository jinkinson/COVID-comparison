# COVID-comparison
This project aims to compare the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States reported by different regularly updated online trackers over time. The two that inspired this project are the New York Times (NYT) and the COVID Tracking Project, and these were the only two being compared initially. However, since then, I have added data from USAFacts and Johns Hopkins University (JHU).

Below you can find links to the sources where I originally got all of the data included here: 

NYT: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us.csv
COVID Tracking Project: https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily/
USAFacts: https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/
